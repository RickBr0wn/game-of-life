            <p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
                Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
                initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
                and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one
                of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts with its eight
                neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in
                time, the following transitions occur:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously
                to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens
                is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The
                rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
